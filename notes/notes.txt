Container of the video player
<div id="full-bleed-container" class="style-scope ytd-watch-flexy">

Container of the next stuff that goes underneath
<div id="columns" class="style-scope ytd-watch-flexy">

style="border: 5px solid red;"

<div id="full-bleed-container" class="style-scope ytd-watch-flexy">
    player container

player controls class="ytp-chrome-controls"

might be able to solve this by changing the maxheight of the player controller to 100% - the size of the player controls
currently it's set to 100vh - 169px ?
 calc(100vh - 48px)

id = full-bleed-container

const id = "full-bleed-container"
const elem = document.getElementById(id)
elem.style.maxHeight = "calc(100vh - 50px)"
