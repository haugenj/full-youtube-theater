# Better YouTube Theater Player

The YouTube theater player view is annoying because it will show the title, likes, and related videos. These are all distracting to actually watching the video. One could use fullscreen mode, but that takes away the view of the rest of your web browser and tabs and whatnot. 

The Better YouTube Theater Player creates a space between the bottom of the video and the rest of the page content, so that all the distracting content is hidden BTF.
